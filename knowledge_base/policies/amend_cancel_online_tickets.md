# Amending and cancelling online rail tickets
All online tickets are only valid on service(s) booked. Amendments and cancellations can only be made prior to travel and where the ticket(s) have not been printed. Once a ticket has been printed, no further changes or amendments can be made to your reservation.

# What Irish Rail highlights
- Amendments/cancellations are only possible **prior to travel**.
- If a ticket has been **printed/collected**, online changes may no longer be possible.
- If a ticket has been **validated** (scanned at station validators or onboard), changes/cancellations may not be allowed.

## Assistant prompts
Ask the user:
- fare type (low / semi-flexible / flexible / first class)
- ticket delivery method (QR vs collect)
- whether it was collected/printed
- whether it was scanned/validated
- how close they are to departure

## When in doubt
Send the user to “Manage My Booking” / the official online ticket T&Cs.
