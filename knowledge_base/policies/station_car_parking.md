# Station car parking (overview)
Over 80 percent of Irish Rail Irish Rail train stations have car parking facilities. Some car parks may be free, some are managed by the local council, but a vast number of our car parks are APCOA managed carparks.
You can check parking facilities in advance of travel at our Station Information section, by inputting your chosen station and scrolling down to Parking and Transport Links.
APCOA Pay and Display Machines will be removed from Irish Rail car parks over the coming weeks.

## How to check
Irish Rail advises checking each station’s “Parking and Transport Links” section for current capacity, charges and notices.
