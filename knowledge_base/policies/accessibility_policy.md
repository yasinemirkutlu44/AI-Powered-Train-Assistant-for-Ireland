# Accessibility policy (expanded)

When you have decided to travel by train, where possible, please let us know in advance of your travel requirements so that arrangements can be made for you to have as comfortable a journey as possible. 
Our staff will use ramps to help you on or off our trains if required. For the below stations, an hour's notice is required to ensure staff can be deployed to assist you on or off your service.12 hours advance notice needs to be given for all other stations to ensure staff can be deployed to assist you on or off your service. 
At some stations there is a gap between the platform and the carriages which may create difficulty for people who are visually impaired or have mobility impairments and assistance may be required when boarding or alighting from the train.
The more information we have about the assistance you require, the better we will be able to assist you.
If you need to cancel a journey for which special arrangements have been made, please let us know so that staff can be made available to assist others.

# JAM Card
The JAM Card was created by NOW Group, a social enterprise that supports people with learning difficulties and autism into jobs with a future and their service users told them that they would like a way to relay to people that they need a little extra time or patience. Find out more about NOW Group at nowgroup.org and JAM Card at jamcard.org.
For those with a learning difficulty, autism, Asperger’s or any condition where there can be a communication barrier, the JAM Card allows users to relay to others that they may need a little extra time in a simple, effective non-verbal manner. The JAM Card is useful when on public transport, in a retail or any other customer facing environment.

# Disabled Car Parking
All our station car parks have designated car parking spaces for European Parking Card holders. They are provided at a convenient location on a concrete or tarmac surface, with dropped kerbs and non-slip pavements where appropriate.

# Wheelchairs/Rollators and Powered Scooters On-Board Trains
There are a limited number of wheelchair accessible spaces on each train, it is important therefore that you book your space in advance.
We can accommodate wheelchair or powered scooters up to 700mm in width and 1200 mm long (including footplates) height 1435mm including occupant a maximum weight of 300kg including occupant and a turning radius of 900mm.
For the comfort of all customers, Rollators must be folded and stored in the luggage racks. Where travelling with an oxygen tank, please call us on 0818 366222 to arrange suitable assistance and seating arrangements.
For safety reasons if your wheelchair or mobility scooter is larger that the permitted dimensions, we cannot accept it as the wheelchair or scooter may not be able to turn corners on board the train.
As scooters come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, many have problems on trains, such as being unable to manoeuvre safely inside a carriage. These problems mean that trains cannot carry some scooters, if you are a scooter user who wants to travel by rail, you should contact the station to ensure your scooter can be accommodated.

## Assistant prompts
Ask:
- origin/destination stations
- whether they need ramp assistance
- whether they need a wheelchair space
- travel date/time (so staffing hours can matter)
