# Tickets explained (detailed summary)

## Buying tickets & travel validity
- Irish Rail describes many online tickets as valid on the **selected service(s)** you booked (see ticket pages and online terms).

## Delivery / collection
Irish Rail describes two common options:
- **Collect at Ticket Machine:** collect at a Ticket Vending Machine before boarding (at stations in the Republic of Ireland).
- **Download QR Ticket(s):** provided as PDF; guidance exists for saving to Apple Wallet.

## Purchase horizon
- Irish Rail ticket pages state that many tickets can be purchased only up to **90 days** in advance.

## Amendments & cancellations (high-level)
Irish Rail’s guidance emphasises:
- Changes/cancellations must be done **prior to travel**.
- Whether you can change may depend on whether you **collected/printed** the ticket and whether it has been **validated/scanned**.

### Fare-type examples described by Irish Rail
Irish Rail lists different windows/fees by fare category. Examples include:
- Some “Low fare” rules: changes/cancellations up to **48 hours** in advance, often with a **fee** plus fare difference (subject to ticket rules).
- Some “Semi flexible” rules: changes/cancellations up to **24 hours** in advance, often with a **fee** plus fare difference.
- “Flexible” and “First Class” are described as allowing changes/cancellations **free** up to **60 minutes** before departure, subject to rules.

> Always treat the Online Tickets Terms and Conditions and the specific fare page as authoritative.

## Passenger types commonly referenced
Irish Rail provides guidance for:
- Adults and children (including “under 5s” travel free with conditions).
- “Reservation only” options for valid ticket holders (limited availability referenced).
- Free Travel Pass holders (limited allocation referenced, with paid option when allocation is full).

## Assistant checklist
Ask:
1) ticket type/fare category
2) QR vs collect-at-machine
3) collected/printed?
4) validated/scanned?
5) how long until departure?
