# Bicycles on trains (expanded)

## Fold-up bikes
- Irish Rail states that fold-up bikes can be carried on all services free of charge (fold the bike before boarding).

## Standard bikes: commuter/DART peak restrictions
Irish Rail publishes peak restrictions for standard bicycles on DART and Commuter services on weekdays. If the user is travelling in rush hour, recommend checking the current policy page and travelling off-peak when possible.

## InterCity Railcar (ICR) bike space dimensions
Irish Rail publishes approximate maximum bike dimensions for ICR bike spaces:
- length 1800 mm
- width 865 mm
- max tyre width 65 mm
It notes that “fat tyre” bikes above the tyre-width limit may not be accommodated in racks.

## Bike parking & lockers at stations
- Where bicycle racks exist, Irish Rail notes they are free to use.
- Some stations offer rentable bicycle lockers (third-party operators), and Irish Rail advises checking the station page under “Parking and Transport links”.

## Assistant tips
- Ask fold-up vs standard bike.
- Ask which service type (DART/commuter vs InterCity).
- Recommend arriving early if travelling with a standard bike.
